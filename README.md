# Welcome to Poost-It App! :tw-1f603: 


#### Installation:

To run this project, you will need to have node installed. After having cloned the code, use the following command to run it on http://localhost:3000

*npm start*


#### Technical decisions:

I decided to add a couple extra functionalities to upgrade the UX such as:
- You can change your Post It color to help you prioritize, categorize or just to have fun!
- An alert will pop up when deleting a Post It from the trash bin (permanently) asking if you are sure, just to prevent any mistake!
- I added a button that deletes every Post It in the Trash bin, so you can save your valuable time!

#### Dependencies:

This project uses three (3) dependencies which were added for the following reasons:
- **React Icon:** For the trash bin and the recycle icons
- **UUID generator:** To generate an unique ID for every Post-It that is created.
- **Classnames:** To apply conditional CSS for the Post-It color change.


## Hope you enjoy it! :tw-1f609:
